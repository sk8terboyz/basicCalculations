## Grade & Rate Calculations

This code was created for a class I took where all code was developed on Linux servers.

This code was developed to fulfill homework requirements, not professional development.

Previous README (typically used to explain the program to peers or answer questions asked by the professor):

hw2-1.py: This program will ask you for the final account balance, annual interest

hw2-2.py: This program will ask you for your grade. This will output the mark equivalent
value and the grade that you inputted. It will also catch if you enter a value other
than a number.
